## set-up migrations

- to set up migrations, run `alembic init migrations` . only run this command once.
- Modify alembic.ini file and set the `sqlalchemy url = sqlite:///school.db`. Choose your database name, mine is school.db, what's yours?
- Modify the `env.py` file in the migrations folder and import the Base class from models file and update the target_metadata.
- To create a migration run, `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"`.
- To apply the generated migration, run `alembic upgrade head`.

Hereâ€™s an enhanced and structured README template for your Bio Management System. It includes details on installation, setup, future plans, and placeholders for live link and GitHub repo:

# Bio Management System

A web application designed to help instructors manage data related to themselves, students, and courses efficiently. The system is built using **FastAPI** for the backend, **Alembic** and **SQLAlchemy** for database management, **Vite React** for the frontend, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- Node.js (>= 14)
- npm or yarn
- SQLite (or your database of choice)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd bio-management-system
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create your SQLite database file:
   ```bash
   touch school.db
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Set-Up Migrations

### Initial Setup

1. Initialize Alembic for database migrations:

   ```bash
   alembic init migrations
   ```

   _(Run this command only once.)_

2. Open the `alembic.ini` file and configure the database URL:

   ```ini
   sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///school.db
   ```

   _(Replace `school.db` with your database name, if different.)_

3. Update the `env.py` file in the `migrations` folder:
   - Import the `Base` class from your `models` file.
   - Update the `target_metadata` variable with your `Base` metadata.

### Running Migrations

1. Create a new migration file:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial migration"
   ```

2. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

---

## Running the Project

### Backend

1. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Future Plans

1. **Authentication System**:
   - Add user roles such as admin, instructor, and student.
   - Secure access to various parts of the application using JWT-based authentication.
2. **Report Writing Capabilities**:
   - Enable instructors to generate and download reports for courses, students, and grades.
